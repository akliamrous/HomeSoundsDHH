ToDo:

1. Floorplan backend: Server recognizes high, med, low, blank. (very basic - heuristic)

2. Fix soundlist: remove search
convert sound -> loudness
location whatever

3.  Test with tablet -- basically two systems

Then you can show to Jon...

4. Logging - High, med, low, and time...

5. Implementing "duration" of high, med, low in server  (+ log) and in list view

6. Change waveform...

7. Noise filter convert to a more sophisticated high med low

8. ..... Somewhere.. Fix and test backend.
