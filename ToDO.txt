ToDo:

4. Logging - High, med, low, and time...

5. Implementing "duration" of high, med, low in server  (+ log) and in list view

7. Reading Jon's slides, web codes, implement sound event recognition well. 

8. Fix and test backend (it sometimes stops updating for some reason... maybe have one web client connection instead of 3? or maybe not?). do noise filtering as well

9. Zoom using css zoom and touchscreen.. (no scroll, for now can also just switch for Jon)

10. Screen bars (delimiters) sould be 1px grey

11. Put some basic furniture in floorplan and use circles instead of boxes. 

12. Adjust y-axis scales on waveform so that all waveforms have common values. Also make sure if max-data is less than say 0.1, just make everything 0 or something.

Done: 
1. Floorplan backend: Server recognizes high, med, low, blank. (very basic - heuristic)
2. Fix soundlist: remove search, convert sound -> loudness, location whatever
3. Test with tablet -- basically two systems
6. Change waveform... (use data from python and some d3 generating library..)
