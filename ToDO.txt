ToDo:

7.a Read Jon's slides.

4. Logging - Data client id (location), timestamp, loudnessLevel, and duration (just like sound list). And client disconnect, connect events.

9. Zoom using css zoom and touchscreen.. (no scroll, for now can also just switch for Jon)

10. Screen bars (delimiters) sould be 1px grey. Soundlist column width adjust to look better.

11a. Put some basic furniture in floorplan

16. Logging client interactions.

Maybes: 
14. Maybe use one socket for all 3 web client for second deployment once you know that all 3 are required...
15. (Later) For soundlist, figure out a way to display past missed data as well. (Ooooh!)

Done: 
1. Floorplan backend: Server recognizes high, med, low, blank. (very basic - heuristic)
2. Fix soundlist: remove search, convert sound -> loudness, location whatever
3. Test with tablet -- basically two systems
5. Implementing "duration" of high, med, low in server  (+ log) and in list view
6. Change waveform... (use data from python and some d3 generating library..)
7. Reading Jon's slides, web codes,implement sound event recognition well.
8. Fix and test backend (it sometimes stops updating for some reason... maybe have one web client connection instead of 3? or maybe not?). do noise filtering as well
11b. and use circles instead of boxes in floorplan.  
12. Adjust y-axis scales on waveform so that all waveforms have common values. Also make sure if max-data is less than say 0.1, just make everything 0.1 and increase scale to 1 or something.


REMEMBER: IF YOU CHANGE 	UPDATE TIME, YOU HAVE TO CHANCE SERVER AND WAVEFORM. AND "RESTART EVERYTHING"

ALSO REMEMBER: FOR TABLETS, ALLOW CHROME TO TAKE MORE CPU.


Testing:

1. Server off for a long time (4hr 45mins). But data client and web-waveform client was on. Both connected successfully on server back up!
2. Server running, all web clients and 1 data client disconnected and connected several times, no problems!
3. 6 connections from mobile and chrome on desktop. Not a problem!
4. Short time disconnecting, connecting with all 3 web clients and 1 data client. Not a problem.

#5. Pilot test with home... (2-5 data clients, 6-15 web sockets).
